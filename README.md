# Test and train your 6th sense (Extrasensory perception (ESP))

![ESP app form](https://github.com/Skoteinos1/ESP/blob/main/Pics/esp.jpg)

How software works:
It picks color, than you try to guess which one was picked. After your guess app picks another color and you have to guess it again. 24 guesses in total.
If you don't know you can skip it. And If you can't decide beween 2 you can select your second guess. 

After right guess you will hear chime and you can choose in code if you want to see random picture from Pics folder (fill it up by yourself).
If your guess was wrong app will show you correct one.

You will get 1 point for correct guess and 0.5 if second guess is correct. Pick second guess only if you can't decide between 2 colors. Not every single time to inflate your score.

Anyone can do it. DO NOT TRY TO FORCE IT. Because you brain will give you something on random. Point of this training is to learn how to distiguish your inner voices. One which gives you something on random and one which is your ESP.

How to interpret your results:
15+ - The force is strong with this one.<br>
12  - If you can achieve this score consistently, CIA has job for you.
 9  - Very good young padawan.
 6  - Yeah, everybody can achieve this by chance.
 3> - There is a secret trick to get better, just click on Red 24x.
